## Features
- Add a new contact with name phone number and email
- View all saved contacts
- Delete a contact by name
- Basic user input handling and validation

## What I Learned
Working on this project helped me practice and understand:
- **Structs**: Using structs to represent a `Contact` with name and phone fields.
- **Vectors**: Storing and managing a dynamic list of contacts.
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Handling references properly when adding, and deleting contacts.
- **Pattern Matching**: Using `match` statements to control user options and handle possible errors.
- **Input/Output**: Reading user input from the terminal and processing it.
- **Error Handling**: Managing common issues like invalid input and empty searches.

## Challenges Encountered
- Managing **borrowing and ownership rules**, especially when modifying the list of contacts.
- Handling **mutable and immutable references** correctly without causing borrow checker errors.
- Keeping the program **interactive** and **user-friendly** while avoiding panics.

And I was able to over come these challenges to the best of my knowledge yet.
